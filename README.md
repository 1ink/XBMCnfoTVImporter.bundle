=================================
The agent is part of the Unsupported Appstore plugin. Installing it, will make
installation and updates of the agent very easy. You can find the appstore here:

Alternatively you can install manually by downloading the zipped bundle from github, extract it, rename it to  **XBMCnfoTVImporter.bundle** and copy it into the plex Plug-ins directory.

e.g.
To enable on Ubuntu, copy the bundle folder into /usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Resources/Plug-ins/
